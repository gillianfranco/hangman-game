# Hangman Game

This game doesn't have a graphical interface and was developed with the goal of practicing the knowledge acquired in the Logic Programming and Algorithms subject of my Computer Engineering course at Uninter University. Among the main concepts practiced in this project are:

- String manipulation
- Data validation
- File handling
- Error and exception handling
- List and dictionary manipulation
- Project organization into separate files
